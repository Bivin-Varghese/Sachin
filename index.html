            <h2>I Am Sachine Ramesh Tendulkar</h2>

            <p>Sachin Tendulkar, in full Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India), Indian
                professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In 2012
                he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international
                play.

                Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score 329
                out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. A year later he scored a century on his
                first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became India’s youngest Test
                (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989. When he was 18
                he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he scored 179 against
                the West Indies. In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s team.
                Although India was defeated in the semifinals of the 1996 World Cup, Tendulkar emerged as the tournament’s top run scorer, with 523 runs. In 1998 he was chosen for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, the highest award given to an Indian athlete, for his outstanding performance in the 1997–98 season. India was defeated by Australia in the 1999 World Cup, failing to advance past the round of six, and was soundly defeated by both Australia and South Africa in series later that year. In the 2003 World Cup, however, Tendulkar helped his team advance as far as the finals. Though India was again defeated by Australia, Tendulkar, who averaged 60.2, was named the man of the tournament.</p>

                <h2>Playing It My Way</h2>

                <p>On 16 November 2013, my cricketing journey finally came to an end at the Wankhede Stadium. After
                    somehow managing to complete my farewell speech, I was having a conversation with my family,
                    trying to soak in every moment, when my team-mate Virat Kohli walked up to me. He said, ‘Paaji
                    aapne kaha tha aap ko yaad dilane ke liye ki aapko pitch pe jana hain.’ (You asked me to remind you
                    that you had to go to the pitch one final time.) To be honest, I hadn’t forgotten; I was just trying to put
                    the moment off for a little longer. It was to be my final visit to the 22 yards that had nurtured and
                    cared for me for so long.
                    As I walked across the outfield I knew so well, my mind was a complete blank. A lump was forming
                    in my throat as I reached the pitch to pay my final regards. I was there for barely fifteen seconds and
                    all I said was, ‘Thank you for taking care of me.’ As I headed back to the pavilion for the last time, my
                    mind was suddenly a muddle of memories. In a matter of seconds I had traversed the entire twentyfour-year journey of my career – from my first net session with my coach Ramakant Achrekar, to
                    getting out for 74 in my final Test innings against the West Indies.
                    It seems to me that no autobiography can claim to document every detail of the author’s life. That’s
                    impossible. There are bound to be issues that can’t be written about for one reason or another, events
                    that are too personal or perhaps too sensitive. Yet I have set out to make this account of my career as
                    close to the full story as I can. Many of the events I describe are, of course, well-known to cricket
                    fans, but I have also tried to talk about a number of things I have not addressed in public before, some
                    of them a little embarrassing, and I hope that readers will find plenty to interest them.
                    Before starting this book, I had to think long and hard about whether it was the right thing to do. It
                    wasn’t an easy decision. I am not in the habit of being sensational for the sake of it or saying things to
                    ruffle feathers. That’s just not me. However, I knew that if I agreed to write my story, I would have to
                    be completely honest, as that’s the way I have always played the game.
                    So here I am, at the end of my final innings, having taken that last walk back to the pavilion, ready
                    to recount as many incidents as I can remember from a career in which I was lucky enough to be able
                    to spend my time Playing It My Way.</p>
